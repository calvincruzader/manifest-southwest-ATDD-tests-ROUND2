features
  -snake case

support
  -hooks.rb

scenario writing
  bottom up
  know what your target is

my_steps.rb
  pending("something meaningful")
  pronouns are bad

when testing for the absence of something, also test the presence of something else
  go beyond the scope of the test

Steps :
  write feature file
  cucumber it/run it
  copy/paste into step file

page class
  -structure of the page only
  -want to do all meaningful testing outside of page class 

Use instance variables in step definitions to remember state of a variable IN THE STEP DEFINITIONS FILE

avoid names that indicate the type of field we want
  page.departure_airpot = "CMH" > page.input_airport("CMH")
  separation of content and implementation on the page

Know what you're going to do before you go about doing it

DOES THAT HAVE A SMELL

@ ONLY USED IF YOU WANT TO USE IT WITHIN THE CLASS IN OTHER STEP DEFS

avoid using include unless you're worried about a particular substring
    can't come up with any way for it to pass if it's broken

write down what you think you should be doing first on the step definitions first before worrying about
implementation

wanna see feedback when a test failed

page object should be the last thing you have to worry about
  figure out how to do the testing properly first
